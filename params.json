In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers. CNTK has been available under an open-source license since April 2015. It is our hope that the community will take advantage of CNTK to share ideas more quickly through the exchange of open source working code.\r\n\r\nWiki: Go to the [CNTK Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki) for all information on CNTK including [setup](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Setup-CNTK-on-your-machine ), [examples](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/Examples ), etc.\r\n\r\nLicense: See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) in the root of this repository for the full license information.\r\n\r\nTutorial: [Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit (CNTK) @ NIPS 2015 Workshops](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/dongyu/CNTK-Tutorial-NIPS2015.pdf)\r\n\r\nBlogs:  \r\n\r\n* [Microsoft Computational Network Toolkit offers most efficient distributed deep learning computational performance](http://blogs.technet.com/b/inside_microsoft_research/archive/2015/12/07/microsoft-computational-network-toolkit-offers-most-efficient-distributed-deep-learning-computational-performance.aspx)\r\n* [Microsoft researchers win ImageNet computer vision challenge (December 2015)](http://blogs.microsoft.com/next/2015/12/10/microsoft-researchers-win-imagenet-computer-vision-challenge/)\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nThe figure below compares processing speed (frames processed per second) of CNTK to that of four other well-known toolkits. The configuration uses a fully connected 4-layer neural network (see our benchmark [scripts](https://github.com/Alexey-Kamenev/Benchmarks)) and an effective mini batch size (8192). All results were obtained on the same hardware with the respective latest public software versions as of Dec 3, 2015.\r\n\r\n![Performance chart](Documentation/Documents/PerformanceChart.png)\r\n\r\n## Citation\r\n\r\nIf you used this toolkit or part of it to do your research, please cite the work as:\r\n\r\nAmit Agarwal, Eldar Akchurin, Chris Basoglu, Guoguo Chen, Scott Cyphers, Jasha Droppo, Adam Eversole, Brian Guenter, Mark Hillebrand, T.
